# Java FM Playground

The Java Foundation Model (FM) Playground is a sample application showcasing how to leverage Amazon Bedrock from Java code.
As any sample application, it is not production-ready. It is provided for the sole purpose of illustrating
how Java developers can leverage Amazon Bedrock to build generative AI-enabled applications.

This repository contains two flavors of the Java FM Playground:

- [Serverless CDK](./serverless-cdk-demo): An AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) project, that deploys the playground as a serverless web application in your AWS account using AWS Lambda and Amazon S3 static website hosting.
- [Spring Boot](./spring-boot-demo): A Spring Boot application with Next.js-based frontend

## Deploy the demo

Please refer to the [Serverless CDK demo README](./serverless-cdk-demo/README.md) and the [Spring Boot demo README](./spring-boot-demo/README.md) for their respective deployment instructions.
