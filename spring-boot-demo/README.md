# 🌱 Spring Boot FM Playground

Welcome to the Spring Boot version of the Java Foundation Model (FM) Playground! This is your sandbox for learning how to build AI-enabled applications using **Amazon Bedrock** and Spring Boot.

> 🚨 **Note:** This demo is not intended for production. It's a learning environment!

## 📦 What's Inside?

This Spring Boot demo has got you covered with:
